- [x] **completed** - Email notification subscription system
- [x] **completed** - Admin dashboard with real-time stats
- [x] **completed** - Auto-scraping every 10 minutes
- [x] **completed** - Fixed build issues (async functions, JWT types, Suspense)

## ðŸš¨ DEPLOYMENT STATUS ðŸš¨
- [x] **FIXED** - Build completes successfully locally with npm and bun
- [x] **FIXED** - Added Node.js runtime declarations to all API routes
- [x] **FIXED** - Created proper environment configuration
- [x] **FIXED** - Updated netlify.toml with Node.js 18 and npm build
- [x] **COMPLETED** - Applied Netlify Edge Runtime fixes (still failing)
- [x] **TESTED** - Environment variables configured in Netlify
- [ ] **IN_PROGRESS** - Netlify still failing - trying Vercel deployment
- [ ] **TODO** - Upgrade @netlify/plugin-nextjs to version 5+
- [ ] **TODO** - Add NETLIFY_NEXT_PLUGIN_SKIP environment variable
- [ ] **TODO** - Try clean Netlify deployment
- [ ] **TODO** - Consider alternative deployment platform (Vercel) if fixes fail

## Technical Implementation:
- Both new scrapers need individual property page fetching for real dates/prices
- Add proper Dutch date parsing for each broker's format
- Implement price extraction patterns specific to each site
- Handle edge cases (missing data, failed requests, etc.)
- Update concurrency in Promise.allSettled for 4 brokers

## Next Steps After 4 Brokers:
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling and retry logic
- [ ] Implement caching to reduce broker website load
- [ ] Add property change notifications
- [ ] Consider deployment optimizations
