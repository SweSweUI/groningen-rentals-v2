1. **Netlify → Vercel conversion**: API calls now use correct Vercel endpoints
2. **Security validation**: Moved from build-time to runtime to prevent deployment failures
3. **Agency counting**: Fixed homepage to use 'agent' field instead of 'source'
4. **Real-time monitoring**: Added live status dashboard showing all agency performance

## 📊 Features Added:
- Real-time status monitoring component
- Live API response times and error tracking
- Console logging for detailed debugging
- Auto-refresh every 2 minutes
- Visual status indicators (working/warning/error)

## 🌐 Deployment Status:
